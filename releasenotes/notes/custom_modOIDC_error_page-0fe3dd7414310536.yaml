features:
  - |
    Enable the configuration of the timeout manager by
    ``OIDCStateTimeout`` variable. We also provide means to
    override the error page for the modOIDC plugin via
    ``{{ node_custom_config }}/keystone/federation/modoidc-error-page.html``
    file.

upgrade:
  - |
    It was added a default template for the modOIDC plugin,
    which will handle authentication errors for federated users.
    The default template is found at
    "ansible/roles/keystone/templates/modoidc-error-page.html.j2";
    it can also be replaced/overwritten. One can also overwrite,
    the timeout, instead of the whole page via the following variable:
    ``keystone_federation_oidc_error_page_retry_login_delay_milliseconds``.
    The default timeout for the page redirection is 5 seconds.
