    ProxySQL is now automatically enabled when MariaDB is enabled.
    MariaDB container healthcheck method was updated as healthcheck script was
    replaced from Clustercheck to official MariaDB docker image's
    `healthcheck.sh <https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/install-and-upgrade-mariadb/installing-mariadb/binary-packages/automated-mariadb-deployment-and-administration/docker-and-mariadb/using-healthcheck-sh>`__
upgrade:
  - |
    Database loadbalancing with HAProxy and MariaDB Clustercheck is no longer
    supported. For the system that uses HAProxy and Clustercheck, upgrading
    MariaDB with ``kolla-ansible upgrade`` will deploy ProxySQL containers and
    remove MariaDB Clustercheck containers.
