    Fluentd now sends logs directly to OpenSearch node IPs instead of using
    a Load Balancer. This change reduces Load Balancer overhead from high
    log volumes. The Load Balancer for OpenSearch remains in place, as it
    is still used by OpenSearch Dashboards. Fluentd continues to handle node
    availability, automatically distributing logs via round-robin to
    available nodes, ensuring log delivery even if individual OpenSearch
    nodes become unavailable.
fixes:

    Fixed Fluentd configuration template to avoid generating unnecessary
    empty lines when optional parameters are not set.
